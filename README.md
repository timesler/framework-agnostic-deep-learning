# Hybrid Pytorch/Tensorflow Project

This repo contains examples of using common code with both the Pytorch and Tensorflow ML/neural network frameworks.

Originally, this project was intended as a way to learn Tensorflow's eager execution mode by porting some typical 
Pytorch code. Hoever, evidenced by the fact that it works with both frameworks, I have adopted this project structure as
a good starting structure for new modelling projects.

Given additional time, I plan to implement more framework-agnostic models, optimizers, and losses.
